    <p>Mankind has always looked to the stars hoping to find intelligent life to save ourselves from pollution and war or even simpler lifeforms to inspire us to change. We found nothing. No insects, no plants, no bacteria. Nothing.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>A century ago, with the Earth teetering on the brink of complete environmental degradation, the Institute for Organic Expansion used every resource available to launch 51 automated vessels equipped with FTL Bubbledrive engines and loaded with spores, seeds and eggs to the empty earth-like planets in hopes of giving mankind somewhere to go once Earth was used up. The Seedpods worked, mostly. After a century, most of the planets have life, though people have only managed to build enough Bubbledrives to colonize a dozen of the closest worlds. The crew of The Artemis work for the Institute to stabilize these new planetary ecosystems, and expand mankindâ€™s reach into the stars. </p>
